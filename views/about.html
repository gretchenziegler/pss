		<h2>About PSS</h2>
		<img id="Rehearsal" src="../public/images/Rehearsal.jpg">
			<p>The Park Slope Singers is a congenial group of about 60 people who like to sing and who get together weekly to make music. We rehearse on Monday evenings in the lower level of St. Saviour Church, at the corner of 8th Avenue and 6th Street in Park Slope, Brooklyn. We perform in concert twice a year, usually in January and June, and each concert is followed by a reception with refreshments that the singers provide.</p>
